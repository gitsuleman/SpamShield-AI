## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "spam detection by custom llm"
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## 📚 Examples

### SMS Spam Detection Example

```python
from spam_detection import analyze_text

# Example SMS message
sms_message = "You have won a prize! Click here to claim it."

# Analyze the SMS message
prediction, probability = analyze_text(sms_message, "SMS")

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Confidence:", probability)
```

### Email Spam Detection Example

```python
from spam_detection import analyze_text

# Example email content
email_content = """
From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Urgent: Your account has been compromised!

Dear recipient,

Your account has been compromised. Please click the link below to reset your password.

Best,
Sender
"""

# Analyze the email content
prediction, probability = analyze_text(email_content, "Email")

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Confidence:", probability)
```

### CSV Batch Processing Example

```python
from spam_detection import process_csv_file

# Example CSV file
csv_file = "example_sms.csv"

# Process the CSV file
results = process_csv_file(csv_file, "SMS", [])

print("Results:")
print(results)
